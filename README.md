# Home-Automation
I have created this project using NodeMCU and Blynk App.
## Blynk App:
In the app add New porject and set the connection type to wifi by NodeMCU. In this project add the button widget and set it to pin V1.
Now just put the authorisation code(found by selecting the nut icon) in the NodeMCU code.
## Code:
For coding I used Arduino IDE software. In there select the device to NodeMCU and download the blynk libraries before starting the code.
Now just upload the code in the NodeMCU.
